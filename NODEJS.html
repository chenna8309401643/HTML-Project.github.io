    <p>Node js is a JavaScript runtime environment that uses Google's V8 engine. This engine was designed to be fast and efficient for running JavaScript code. Node js is faster than java because it uses an asynchronous event-driven I/O model and does not have the overhead of the Java runtime environment.</p>
